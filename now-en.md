Here’s what I’m working on now, in no particular order:

* **Trying something new (Elixir)**

    Obviously elixir is new to me, since i was working for a bangalore based startup which uses *ruby* only. Many ruby    communities in *bangalore* slowly introduced **Elixir** in to talks. So 2018 is for elixir, and to build something
    
* **ConnectedInn and GreenWindow in bucket list**

    `ConnectedInn` and `GreenWindow` is two of my hobby projects which started couple of months before. `ConnectedInn` is somewhat inherited for LinkedIn.`GreenWindow` is kind a recruitment platform for startups with live coding interview support and which is a multi-tenant application. Both in ruby on rails.
